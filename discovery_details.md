#Participant 1: A.M.

1. How often do you park on campus? What's a typical week like for you?

he parks 4-5 times a week, two of those days is for class in the morning(hutch), other days are variable(gym, lib, etc.). He’s been parking since sophomore year

2. Tell me about the last time you paid for parking on campus. What was that experience like?

he pays everytime, to avoid lag on app. he goes to order history, and orders again. app is very laggy. map sucks feature. better on the list

3. Have you ever decided NOT to pay for parking? What happened?

he has a few times because if hes parking on campus(he would pay for C and park in A) and take chance he doesnt get caught(stays past 5). If hes going to campus for less than an hour, going to tennis courts or the field. 1 in 30 times. Time and location plays a factor. he thinks its riskier to go to a dense parking lot(always pay at hutch, mu, arc) not paid olson lot, tennis courts, etc.

4. When was the last time you got a parking ticket? What were the circumstances?
    1. Follow up: How did that make you feel
    2. Follow up: What did you do differently after that?
    
    parking ticket at the arc last year. literally cuz he tried and the app didnt load so he said fuck he didnt pay. another time was bc he paid for someone elses parking but he forgot to swithc license plates
    
    thats when he swithced to order history instead of map(less latency)
    
5. What's hard about the current parking situation on campus? Why is that hard?

Lack of information(all info is gained from experience, not taps) one off parkers have harder time, not experience

You just know the availability of every zone at every time, knowing ticketing schedules. Knwoing how long you have before the risk goes up, when is parking the most competitive vs when its easy to get.

6. How do you deal with parking costs now?
    1. Do you avoid certain lots?
    2. Do you skip class/activities because of parking?

He thinks unreasonable bc if it wasnt for his job, he wouldnt be able topay. he doesnt skip anything but he avoid the MU at all cost bc hard to get parking(contribute to him going to this side of campus less). Hutch a lot more because it has most availability, go to ARC because a lot of inflow outflow

7. What workarounds have you found to avoid paying for parking? Have you tried any apps or tools to help with campus parking?
    1. How do other students you know handle parking?
    
    sophomore, C+ parking garage floor he got away with it pretty frequently
    
8. If you could change one thing about parking on campus, what would it be?

he wish he could buy quarterly parking permits. Because it allows better for commuters. Find parking but also the uncertainty of finding parking. He can cap permits and make people know they have a spot. only competing with a smaller pool. a lot more stable

yes if he didn’t have job

#Participant 11: S.P.
1. How often do you park on campus? What's a typical week like for you?

“I never parked on campus, because it cost too much.” A typical week would just be her bussing to campus and bussing back. 

2. Tell me about the last time you paid for parking on campus. What was that experience like?

Was running late for an exam, took her car, but it ended up taking her the same time as it took for a bus to get there, and took extra long because she had to find parking as well. That experience was hectic, and would not do it again.

3. Have you ever decided NOT to pay for parking? What happened?

Yea I did, once. BUt she was really paranoid that she would get a ticket, but in the end, didn’t end up getting charged. Rushing to class, ad promised herself that she would do it once she got to class, but forgot to pay. Then, she paid after class. 

4. When was the last time you got a parking ticket? What were the circumstances?

Never got a parking ticket — she lied. HSe got a parking ticket during orientation week when she was an OL. She parked in the wrong section (A/C+/C). Paid for a different section than the one she parked in, and got ticketed for it.

1. Follow up: How did that make you feel

Felt unfair, because it was her first time parking, and didn’t know how to park. Parking app doesn’t do a good job of explaining that information. In the parking lot, the areas are not physically marked, but it’s only marked in the app. You ahve to make sure you’re in the right section you’re paying for in the app.

2. Follow up: What did you do differently after that?

Make sure that she was parking in the right spot.

5. What's hard about the current parking situation on campus? Why is that hard?

Don’t think its hard, its just tedious. Too much work to go to lots, find parking, making sure its the right section.

    1. Do you avoid certain lots?
    
    She would just take the bus.
    
    1. Do you skip class/activities because of parking?

Did not skip class - stopped driving to campus entirely. On specific days where she missed the bus and didn’t want to pay for parking, just missed class.

7. What workarounds have you found to avoid paying for parking? Have you tried any apps or tools to help with campus parking?

Doesn’t know of any work arounds.

1. How do other students you know handle parking?

Lot of people don’t mind spending the money, other friends just got away with not paying. People just got lucky sometimes. Sometimes unlucky, would get charged while walking to class, would pay for a ticket after getting charged, etc (double whammy)

8. If you could change one thing about parking on campus, what would it be?

Lower prices, and sectioning it by class/grade : seniors getting priority parking, etc.

9. Is the cost of parking actually a problem for you, or is it something else?

Cost is primarily the issue, second is the time it takes to park. Third is the distance it takes to walk. 

10. Is there anything else about parking on campus that frustrates you that we haven't talked about?

No, covered everything.
