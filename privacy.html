  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

  <p>
    TapOut ("the App") is a UC Davis campus parking enforcement alert app.
    This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights as a user.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Email address.</strong> Collected when you verify your account via
      one-time passcode (OTP). Used solely to authenticate your account.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Device identifier.</strong> A random UUID generated on your device
      and stored securely in the iOS Keychain. Used as your account identifier
      for all authenticated requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Push notification token.</strong> Collected if you grant notification
      permission. Used to send you TAPS alerts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Parking activity.</strong> Lot check-ins, check-outs, TAPS sightings
      you report, and votes you cast on sighting reports. Used to power the
      community feed and occupancy stats.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ticket photos.</strong> If you use the Scan Ticket feature, a photo
      of your parking ticket is uploaded to our server for text extraction (OCR)
      to auto-fill a TAPS report. The image is not stored after processing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Optional sighting notes.</strong> Free-text notes you may attach to
      a TAPS sighting report. Visible to other users in the community feed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>All data collected is used exclusively to operate the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticating your account and securing API access.</li>
    <li>Displaying real-time parking occupancy and TAPS sighting feeds.</li>
    <li>Sending push notifications when TAPS is spotted near your parked location.</li>
    <li>Processing ticket photos to auto-generate sighting reports.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not use your data for advertising, marketing, analytics sold to third
    parties, or any purpose unrelated to the App's core functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.
    Your data is stored on our backend server (Google Cloud App Engine) and is
    not disclosed to outside parties except as required by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App allows you to open AMP Parking or Honk Mobile via a deep link when
    a TAPS alert is received. Tapping that link hands you off to that app — we
    do not share any of your data with those services.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account data (email, device ID) is retained while your account is active.</li>
    <li>Ticket photos are deleted from our servers immediately after OCR processing.</li>
    <li>Parking sessions and sightings are retained to power historical predictions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time by
    contacting us at the address below. Upon request we will delete your email
    address, device identifier, and all associated parking and sighting records.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
    personal information from children under 13.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the
    top of this page will reflect any changes. Continued use of the App after
    changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
