## Elevator Pitch

WarnABrotha is a parking enforcement tracking app designed for UC Davis students to avoid parking tickets. The app provides real-time alerts when TAPS (Transportation and Parking Services) is spotted at parking structures, enabling students to make informed decisions about their parking. The AI Feature can be a model that uses the data to predict if a user will recieve a ticket when parking at a certain spot.
