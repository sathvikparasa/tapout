## Iteration 1
Our first round of testing revealed three core usability issues. Users consistently tried to tap the risk meter expecting more information, didn't understand what the check-in button did, and experienced text cutoff on the risk meter display. The ticket scanner was also flagged as low value — users understood the concept but felt no personal motivation to use it. Based on this feedback, we renamed the check-in button to "Get Notifications" to make the value exchange explicit, made the risk meter clickable with explanations for each risk level, and rewrote the risk descriptions to be concise enough to display without truncation. We held off on changing the ticket scanner to gather more signal before committing to a direction.

## Iteration 2
The fixes from iteration 1 meaningfully improved the core experience. All three users found the main workflows intuitive and easy, with report and notification flows consistently rated 10/10. However, introducing a new scenario where users had to respond to a live TAPS notification uncovered an important behavioral insight: all three users had their phones on Do Not Disturb, meaning our alerts never reached them. This was a user behavior we had not previously accounted for. In response, we converted TAPS report notifications into time-sensitive alerts, which bypass most iOS focus modes. While DND specifically remains a limitation, we are exploring Live Activities as a long-term solution to surface alerts persistently on the lock screen. The ticket scanner remained a weak point, so we added a records page allowing users to track their own ticket history as a personal use case.

## Iteration 3
This round produced the most mixed signals. No users naturally navigated to the records tab, suggesting that despite early interest in ticket tracking, it may not be compelling enough as a standalone feature. We are currently exploring autofilling the UC Davis ticket payment page from a scanned ticket, though bot protection on the payment site is an active technical challenge. We also identified inconsistencies introduced by our previous iterations. Most notably, the map still displays "Check In" even though the main page was updated to "Get Notifications." Additionally, by making the risk meter descriptions more concise, we inadvertently made it less clear whether the risk level updates per lot or reflects a global state. Our focus for the next iteration is consistency across the app before introducing any new features.
