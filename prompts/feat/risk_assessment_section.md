# Goal: Create Risk Asessment Section

## Feature Description

In `ButtonsTab` there is a Current Risk Meter and a 'Recent Activity' subsection. Create a new section by combining these and have label the new subsection 'Risk Indicators' (remove the 'Recent Activity' section header). The actual content in the sections should be the same, just move them around

## Constraints

- Do not modify `.xcodeproj` / `.pbxproj`
- Do not commit anything to git
- Do not refactor unrelated code — surgical fix only
- Keep `hideTabBar` opacity/hitTesting logic intact (used by MapTab)
- Use only SwiftUI — no UIKit layout overrides
