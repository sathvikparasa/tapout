# Important: These Changes are ONLY for the android version.

# Feed Redesign

Make the feed show all lots by default, and add a button on top with the word "ALL".

# Add a map view

Add a button in the bottom navigation as the rightmost button, and make it a map view of the UC Davis campus. Don't add anything else, just a full screen view that allows you to look and scroll through the map using a Google maps SDK or something.

# Rules

Always remember to use the @frontend-design plugin for any changes you make.

Create a new file CLAUDE.md in the .claude/ directory and update it if you make a mistake with what you did wrong, and how you fixed it.

Do not commit anything to git without prior permission.

Ask questions if you are confused.
