# Backend Update
I need you to clean up the code that relates to the iOS app. Mostly contained in backend/ and warnabrotha/


## Prep Work
Make sure to read through all the existing code before making changes to understand the current layout. As a rule of thumb, always do this before making changes.

## Deliverables
### Clean Backend with Streamlined Layout
I need the backend to be clean. Right now, there are remnants of the Docker/Alembic-based DB, but now we are entirely using Supabase. If you have any doubts, please refer to documents in prompts/ and docs/ and ask questions if needed.
