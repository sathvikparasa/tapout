# Goal: Redesign Android App

The android app design looks like shit. The Windows95 theme is not fitting the theme/exigence of the app, and it is functionally drawing away from the UX due to its clunky interface and design.

# Task

Use your frontend-design plugin to design a better UI for the app. Keep it simple, but use Nextdoor and Citizen as inspirations. The tiny things matter - if there's a new report, add a red circle on the top right of the feed nav nbutton, etc.

Change the layout to whatever makes the most sense, based on apps like Citizen.

THe core functionality should be the same. The app should be simple to use, and intuitive.

Use UX best practices and @frontend-design plugin to help you. Reason through your choices.

Remember to match all frontend code to backend functionality -- do not skip anything.

I will build and run the app.
