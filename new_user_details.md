# Participant 1
## Phase 1: Setup

“Thanks for taking the time to help me out. I'm working on an app and I want to see how real people use it so there are no wrong answers here, I'm testing the app, not you. If anything feels confusing or broken, that's super useful for me to know. Please think out loud as you go through it.”

## Phase 2: First Glance

Show TapOut homepage for 10 seconds then close it.

What do you think this app does? 

its a parking app that tell you the risk of getting a ticket in a certain area.

who do you think it’s made for?

people who park on uc davis campus

What stood out to you most?

The two big buttons and the very linear design

## Phase 3: The Task

Scenario 1: You just parked at Hutch and you're not sure if you need to buy a ticket. Open TapOut and decide whether it's safe to park without one. 

*See if they check in naturally*

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

select parking zonze(MU → hutch). it says risk is medium(the words got cut off), it say no recent TAPS activity. medium risk she would pay for parking. she checked in. she doesnt know the benefit of her checking in(not clear)

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

she was able to determine to pay because there was medium risk(she doesnt understand the risk. is it of getting a ticket? )

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

Yes, she wasnt sure if she was supposed to check in or not. 

- "On a scale of 1–10, rate the difficulty of this task? 1 being very easy and 10 being very difficult. What would make it a 10?"

navigating parking zone is intuitive and risk meter is intuitive. 9/10. 10/10 if she could say what the risk meter says.

Scenario 2:

 You're walking to your car and you spot a tap officer writing tickets two rows over. Use TapOut to warn other people in the lot.

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

she did it well

After the task:

- "Were you able to complete that? Walk me through what you did."

saw button that says report taps and she saw taps so she pressed the button.

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

very clear

- "On a scale of 1–10, how easy was that? What would make it a 10?"

10/10

## Phase 4:

"You just got a parking ticket. Use TapOut to scan it.”

- "What do you think just happened when you submitted that?"

she has no idea what happened when she did that. she thinks it just gev her ticket details, saved ticket to her account. she did not think it was worth it.

- "When do you feel like you would use this feature?"

she wouldn’t use this feature.

- "What would make you *more* likely to submit a ticket after getting one?"

Maybe discounted parking/ didn’t have to pay my ticket. Maybe even why she was submitting the ticket.

## Phase 5: The Debrief

- "What's the main thing this app does, in your own words?"

She thinks this app helps you determine if she should park there if taps is in the area or not.

- "What's the one thing you'd change or add if you could?"

she wants to know why she’s doing certain things(why check in, why scan ticket, why report taps)

- "Would you actually use this? What would need to be true for you to open it regularly?"

She would pay for parking regardless so if this is short term parking, she would be more likely to use this. campus for whole day→ pay for parking. To her low risk is still risky(very risk averse)

- "Would you tell a friend about this? How would you describe it to them?"

Tell them what it is. only owuld tell her friends if they get a parking ticket. 

Additonal thoughts:

ticket tracker: log tickets to know how much the next one costs.

## Phase 2: First Glance

Show TapOut homepage for 30 seconds then close it.

What do you think this app does? 

It looks like  a tap reporting app, saw it had arc, hutch, and MU, saw risk of taps. saw that y can report.

who do you think it’s made for?

students

What stood out to you most?

the risk of taps stood out the most because it had brighter colors

## Phase 3: The Task

Scenario 1: You just parked at Hutch and you're not sure if you need to buy a ticket. Open TapOut and decide whether it's safe to park without one. 

*See if they check in naturally*

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?
- Were they able to complete tasks?

she checked in naturally. wouldnt pay for parking bc taps hasnt been sighted. if a lot more user were checked in, she would be more comfortable paying for parking

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

she checked in, saw that it said taps hasn’t been sighted. then she went to a map to see how many ppl chekced in to see if its an accurate assessment. saw 0 ppl checked in so ended up paying

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

wasnt sure what the map is for. it had more insights that are necessary

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the difficulty of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

3, wasnt too bad when she figured out the map. if you could click the risk and then it takes you to the map for more stats. doesnt understand how it works. text cuts off.

 Scenario 2: Report taps at Hutch.

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

pretty straightforwards

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the difficulty of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"
- 10

## Phase 4:

"You just got a parking ticket. Use TapOut to scan it.”

- "What do you think just happened when you submitted that?"

the ai at the app looked at the ticket details and recorded it.

- "When do you feel like you would use this feature?"

if she wanted to be a good samaritan

- "What would make you *more* likely to submit a ticket after getting one?"

she sits on car and ponders after getting ticker, if she saw taps risk was low, she would scan ticket

## Phase 5: The Debrief

- "What's the main thing this app does, in your own words?"

this app is for students to know if they should pay for parking or not, what level of taps activity. and scna tickets to help students

- "What's the one thing you'd change or add if you could?"

making sure the risk meter could be clickable with more details

- "Would you actually use this? What would need to be true for you to open it regularly?"

She would use this once she knows theres a good amount of student actually using it. only if 100 ppl on the app, not good enough % of student body.

- "Would you tell a friend about this? How would you describe it to them?"

She would tell a friend about and says “found this app when taps is here so you dont have to pay til the last minute”

What stood out to you most?

Simplicity of checking in to a sturcture and reporting at that structure. can see risk

## Phase 3: The Task

- Were they able to complete tasks?

tried to tap the risk card

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

want to buy ticket. checked into the structure naturally, saw that the risk was high and wnet to clock it for information, realized it wasnt a button. checked recent activity to see what the activity was, accidentally clicked the map.

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

not confused

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the difficulty of the tasks? 1 being easy 10 being difficult. What would make it a 1?"

1

 Scenario 2: You are walking back to your car and you see taps officers ticketing the floor below you. please use Tapout to report them

assuming info would send a report it or adds to the database

- "When do you feel like you would use this feature?"

probably if he got a ticket to alert other

- "What would make you *more* likely to submit a ticket after getting one?"

he doesnt know, its altruisitc. his first thought would not be scan ticket

## Phase 5: The Debrief

- "What's the main thing this app does, in your own words?"

The app allows you to check in to dif parking stuctures to see rick and allow you to notify other users if you spot taps. scan ticket to scan info

- "What's the one thing you'd change or add if you could?"

first thought. report taps button is very simple. this app is assumign you wouldnt pay for parking, there doesnt seem to be any verification that you actually saw taps or you are in parking garage. he pays for parking. 

- "Would you actually use this? What would need to be true for you to open it regularly?"

Drive to campus like a couple times a quarter. wouldnt instinctually use it. if this was a well known resouce people talk about. download it to pay for parking.

- "Would you tell a friend about this? How would you describe it to them?"

he would tell his friends. he will tell friends who complained about tickets about a crowdsource way to pay for parking before you get ticketed.

## Phase 3: The Task

Scenario 1: You just parked at Hutch and you're not sure if you need to buy a ticket. Open TapOut and decide whether it's safe to park without one. 

*See if they check in naturally*

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?
- Were they able to complete tasks?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

go to hutch, risk meter was high, so she would pay for parking. she doesnt know where you would go pay but she put buttons. thought she could straight from app.

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

She didn’t know how to pay. 

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

10/10

## Phase 2: First Glance

Show TapOut homepage for 10 seconds then close it.

What do you think this app does? 

subscribe to dif parking alerts to get live alerts on parking and taps risks, live meter of likelihood of taps being around, check when youre about to parl. alert onw hat taps activity is like. youc an scan to get ticket, assuming verification of risk

who do you think it’s made for?

students

What stood out to you most?

subscription UI is pretty clean, easy. Livefeed dashboard, if there was a way to adjust the timeframe from more than 3 hours. explanation for risks seemed reasonable.

## Phase 3: The Task

Scenario 1: You just parked at Hutch and you're not sure if you need to buy a ticket. Open TapOut and decide whether it's safe to park without one. 

*See if they check in naturally*

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?
- Were they able to complete tasks?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

opened the risk meter, subscribe to alerts and go about the day.

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

the lead line is confusing because it doesnt say they will return soon. for medium specifically. Medium should just read “likely to return soon”

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

7, the only deterrent was knowing he had to subscribe. if he saw medium, he’s just gonna pay because he’s very ticket averse. if he i knew it was report base from the getgo, he would subscribe

 

Scenario 2: You get an alert that TAPS was in Hutch. Tap the noti to pay for parking 

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

did not work on his ened for notification, could be bc of D&D. worked on my phone

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

it didnt work

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

pretty easy

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

10/10, no notes

Scenario 3: You are walking back to your car and you see taps officers ticketing the floor below you. please use Tapout to report them 

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

he jsut pressed the button and confirmed

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

pretty clear

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"
- 10/10

## Phase 4:

"You just got a parking ticket. Use TapOut to scan it.”

- "What do you think just happened when you submitted that?"

increases the risk of the location that it was assigned to, checks the date against it that could add to risk

- "When do you feel like you would use this feature?"

when he got a ticket and once to report it. if he alr got ticket, he will jsust report it. there no valuable info on the ticket of going through hassle to verify its true.

- "What would make you *more* likely to submit a ticket after getting one?"

if there was more info that it could provide another user. 

## Phase 5: The Debrief

- "What's the main thing this app does, in your own words?"

allow sudents to report taps sightings to other students and student who receive alerts will then determine if they want to pay. gives noti for them to pay

- "What's the one thing you'd change or add if you could?"

More information in the notification itself. if hes scanning ticket and it shows level, then he could have an more informed decison. he went back and said never mind

- "Would you actually use this? What would need to be true for you to open it regularly?"

he would use the app. he would need accurate info and pretty consistent stream. not getting spammed also

- "Would you tell a friend about this? How would you describe it to them?"

app that give more info on whether or not you should pay for parking.

Bugs: only working for arc

other thoughts: if he knew how many people are checkd in, it would help

## Phase 2: First Glance

Show TapOut homepage for 10 seconds then close it.

What do you think this app does? 

alerts if theres a tap sighting based on RISK depending ona dif place. u can also report taps yourself. also feed gives live updates of taps activity, filter by location scan is like scan ticket, not fully sure what it does. 

who do you think it’s made for?

Students who dont fuck with taps

What stood out to you most?

Really like the risk indicators of what she was able to see, categorizes it based on recent tap activity. Red for high risk is uper blaring. 

## Phase 3: The Task

Scenario 1: You just parked at Hutch and you're not sure if you need to buy a ticket. Open TapOut and decide whether it's safe to park without one. 

*See if they check in naturally*

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?
- Were they able to complete tasks?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

checked in naturally because the risk is LOW at hutch and its almost two hours since taps was seen. waiting on taps alert.

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

pretty clear

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

10/10

 Scenario 2: You get an alert that TAPS was in Hutch. Tap the noti to pay for parking 

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

didnt work, she turns off notis for all apps, fear of noti during class. always on D&D

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

ddint work so we used my phone, pressed noti

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

didnt work bc she turned out messages, she said if there was an SMS or email alert, she would check it more

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

8/10. Takes from notification and goes straight to parking app and the specific lot.

Scenario 3: You are walking back to your car and you see taps officers ticketing the floor below you. please use Tapout to report them 

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

"You just got a parking ticket. Use TapOut to scan it.”

- "What do you think just happened when you submitted that?"

she thinks it read what info and categorized based on time and location

- "When do you feel like you would use this feature?"

she would not use this feature. she would not do it over pressing the button.

- "What would make you *more* likely to submit a ticket after getting one?"

Maybe if the ticket took her to the site that she needs to pay for ticket and autofills it on that website

## Phase 5: The Debrief

- "What's the main thing this app does, in your own words?"

2 main things: knows the risk for when they park so she can determine if she can pay money or not. second is alert if there is TAPS so she can pay for parking if need be. “Saves me money”

- "What's the one thing you'd change or add if you could?"

2 things she said earlier: ticket scan → pay ticket website. AMP app integration. If it could track your location  so she wont rmb to check out. she wont rmb to check in. she wants it to be tied to location

- "Would you actually use this? What would need to be true for you to open it regularly?"

She would use this. She would forget in the beginning but after forming a habit she would rememeber. the incentive to saving money from parking is enough.

- "Would you tell a friend about this? How would you describe it to them?"

Yes tell them and describe it as a way to save money and get back at TAPS.

## Phase 2: First Glance

Show TapOut homepage for 10 seconds then close it.

What do you think this app does? 

Looks like it monitors when TAPS comes into the main aprking strucutres and she could report when she sees them. looks like if she gets alerts but she doesn’t know for what and shec could check in whatverv that means. → need to change check in on maps

who do you think it’s made for?

People that parks at this places, students, not just commuters

What stood out to you most?

Main page, surprised that map wasn’t the home page. feels like she hads to look around to figure out what she’s doing. she is pro-map.

## Phase 3: The Task

Scenario 1: You just parked at Hutch and you're not sure if you need to buy a ticket. Open TapOut and decide whether it's safe to park without one. 

*See if they check in naturally*

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?
- Were they able to complete tasks?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

first thing was look at the map because it’s more clear, click on hutch, see there has been 0 taps in the last hour, confused if the risk meter changes on what she chooses.(might need to add location back). Since only 1 person is checked in might not be reliable. she would buy a ticket because TAPS hasn’t visited in a while. did not check in naturally. she likes the risk meter pop out.

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

She didn’t know what check in does and look at the thing if she sees TAPS. Only way where she would see TAPS is if she checks in or if she’s leaving. She did’t know the Risk meter changes for all of them. confused about the alerts button and checking in. 

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

8/10. she is scared about pressing the buttons. she’s not sure how to make it better aside from seeing how many times has taps been there, need more people on the app.

 

Scenario 2: You get an alert that TAPS was in Hutch. Tap the noti to pay for parking 

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

notification didn’t work, check bug

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

it didn’t work, she thought concept was cool though

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

if it worked, 10/10. but it did not

Scenario 3: You are walking back to your car and you see taps officers ticketing the floor below you. please use Tapout to report them 

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

she pressed the button and confirmed

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

stragiht forward

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

10/10

## Phase 4:

"You just got a parking ticket. Use TapOut to scan it.”

- "What do you think just happened when you submitted that?"

it extracted info from the ticket. she doesn’t know why the app needs the ticket details

- "When do you feel like you would use this feature?"

she would not use it ever. there was an app called fetch where u scan receipts and get points but she didn’t want to do it anymore despite getting money from it.

- "What would make you *more* likely to submit a ticket after getting one?"

She would just need reminder. noted she wouldn’t use the feed feature.

## Phase 5: The Debrief

- "What's the main thing this app does, in your own words?"

the app is used to report when TAPS goes to a min parking place on campus and notified people that are parked there.

- "What's the one thing you'd change or add if you could?"

Maybe for the AMP at HONK mobile, doesn’t seem like settings thing. wants it to be more clear. also scanning the ticket doesn’t make sense. she also wants the upvotes to be visible on the front page. having a personal record of her ticekts jsut makes her sad

- "Would you actually use this? What would need to be true for you to open it regularly?"

Yeah, she would use it, esp since she’s a commuter. once she gets noti, she would start using it.

- "Would you tell a friend about this? How would you describe it to them?"

Yea, she would tell her commuter friends to use it. Use the app to see when TAPS is ticketing, these four locations, not anywhere else.

# Participant 9
## Phase 1: Setup

“Thanks for taking the time to help me out. I'm working on an app and I want to see how real people use it so there are no wrong answers here, I'm testing the app, not you. If anything feels confusing or broken, that's super useful for me to know. Please think out loud as you go through it.”

## Phase 2: First Glance

Show TapOut homepage for 10 seconds then close it.

What do you think this app does? 

It seems like you are getting alerts from parking structures and tells you when taps is and how long since theyve been there. tells everything he needs to know

who do you think it’s made for?

students who drive. everyone compliains about taps and parking tickets

What stood out to you most?

expected it to be complicated but realized there isnt much you are able to do, it just looks like a lot. a little overwhelming to begin with, after playing around with it, its intuitive

## Phase 3: The Task

Scenario 1: You just parked at Hutch and you're not sure if you need to buy a ticket. Open TapOut and decide whether it's safe to park without one. 

*See if they check in naturally*

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?
- Were they able to complete tasks?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

went to hutch, and then he tapped on risk meter. he would pay for parking because he’s risk averse and medium is high

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

he felt it was pretty clear

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

9/10, he is not sure, he thinks there’s a lot of tabs so theres potential of confusion

 Scenario 2: You get an alert that TAPS was in Hutch. Tap the noti to pay for parking 

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

i pressed the report and he didnt get it and he didnt know he had to press the button to get reports.

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

he feels like the check in part was a little confusing, he didnt know what alerts meant, he thought that if selected the dropdown it would indicate he gets alerts

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

6/10. Just the idea, he wants clearer indication to press the button when he gets there. the risk meter is indicating if he should pay or not but then he didnt realize he needed to also get alerts.

Scenario 3: You are walking back to your car and you see taps officers ticketing the floor below you. please use Tapout to report them 

**Observe silently. Note:**

- Where do they click first?
- Where do they pause or seem confused?

After the task:

- "Walk me through what you did."

he clicked all the tabs before clicking the button.

- "Was there any moment where you weren't sure what to do next?"

he was jsut messing with the app because there are multiple ways to do the same thing

- "On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate the ease of the tasks? 1 being difficult 10 being easy. What would make it a 10?"

actual task was 10/10. 8/10 too many ways to report TAPS.

## Phase 4:

"You just got a parking ticket. Use TapOut to scan it.”

- "What do you think just happened when you submitted that?"

went to some database and filled the same report thing. is there anyway to verify if that was true and hwo can we verify if its true

- "When do you feel like you would use this feature?"

if he already got a ticket and its been a couple hours. helps app algo to detect general time of day. it would make it more accurate over time

- "What would make you *more* likely to submit a ticket after getting one?"

incentive is he would be pissed off and bc he is pissed off, this is his way of rebellion

## Phase 5: The Debrief

- "What's the main thing this app does, in your own words?"

Main thing, report taps, record ticket records, optimal for paying for parking and the time you’re doing it. if only campus for a little bit, need to know if he should pay

- "What's the one thing you'd change or add if you could?"

personally, its confusing that there are multiple ways to do the same thing, overwhelming. difficult to first understand

- "Would you actually use this? What would need to be true for you to open it regularly?"

he would, he doesnt drive to campus much but if he did like he used to, he would. he would add it to workflow and only would not pay if risk meter was low. if it sadi low and he still got ticket, it would cause distrust if more people used it, he would trust more. it would encourage him to drive more becauas only reason he’s not is because of paying for parking

- "Would you tell a friend about this? How would you describe it to them?"

he would tell many people, and he would market it as a risk meter.
