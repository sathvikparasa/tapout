After conducting 11 discovery interviews, we discovered two major pain points of campus parking: price and availability.
Our product tackles the pricing issue by allowing students to rely on our community watch system to only pay when necessary, reducing unnecessary parking costs. Beyond cost savings, the check-in system serves as a payment reminder, addressing the common problem of students forgetting to pay and getting ticketed. There was also a apin point of lack of information. We will explore adding a information tab with quick parking tips and rules that students currently learn through expensive trial-and-error.
In terms of availability, we explored creating a density heatmap but that would require either a large user base for live data or historical parking records. We currently don't have either, but we added a feature showing how many users checked in to each parking lot. As we scale, this feature should become more accurate for drivers to determine where they want to park.
Importantly, there's no downside to checking in. Even students who always pay benefit from reminders and crowd-sourced density data, making the app valuable across different risk tolerance levels.
While interviews surfaced systemic issues like AMP's poor UX and strong demand for quarterly parking passes, these require university buyin and that falls outside our project scope.
In regards to our thought process, these interviews resoundingly validated our problem. This confirmation gives us more confidence in what we're building.
